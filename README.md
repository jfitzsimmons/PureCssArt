# PureCssArt

## Main Street at Dusk (CSS, HTML)

Inspired by [cyanharlow.github.io/purecss-lace](https://cyanharlow.github.io/purecss-lace/). 

Rules I have for myself:

1. ~~All~~ (Most) elements must be typed out by hand
2. Only VS Code text editor and Developer Tools allowed.

Because of the artistic nature of this project I have not concerned myself with cross-browser-compatibility, so the live preview will look laughable in anything other than MOZILLA FIREFOX :-)
